# Request component changes

Start by reading the guidelines in our **[Get started](/get-started/)** section.
If you have decided that you want to use Warp, but you need to extend the design system to fit your needs.
This is the guide for you.

## Consider this

Things to consider when requesting component changes:

- How does this change affect the overall product?
- If no, is this something that benefits more than just your team?
- What variants and use cases do you see?

Reach out to the Warp team on slack [#nmp-warp-design-system](https://sch-chat.slack.com/archives/C04NF2K46LB) with your request, and we will help you.
