# Request new component

Start by reading the guidelines in our **[Get started](/get-started/)** section.
If you have decided that you want to use Warp, but you need to extend the design system to fit your needs.
This is the guide for you.

## Consider this

Things to consider when requesting a new component:

- Does something similar exist? If yes, can you use it with a tweak? See “request changes to an existing component” below.
- If no, is this something that benefits more than just your team?
- What variants and use cases do you see?

Reach out to the Warp team on Slack: [#nmp-warp-design-system](https://sch-chat.slack.com/archives/C04NF2K46LB) with your request, and we will help you.

## Prioritisation of component requests
We prioritise the requests based on:

- How many teams will benefit from this component? (Never less than 2)
- How complicated or time-consuming is it to build this component?
